# Analysis of Adult Obesity and Food Environment in U.S.A 
This project is result of interest in studies concerning food dessert and food swamp. To address the problem of food deserts, the Healthy Food Financing Initiative supports opening full-service grocery stores. Studies evaluating the impact of such new grocery stores have shown that, diet quality and body mass index do not improve in relation to such initiatives. The concept of food swamp was introduced based upon contradicting findings on food dessert and number of grocery stores. Food swamp looks into neighborhoods to see weather fast food and junk food temper healthy alternatives.
# Question Explored
The question that started this project is: How does proximity and access to grocery stores, fast food restaurants, and socioeconomic status relates to obesity at county level?
	
To answer this question R Shiny app was developed which maps county level obesity trends in U.S.A along with socioeconomic and health indicators information. It also shows relationship between different environmental factors and obesity across different states.
